## Introduction
Runtime Sets are simply a collection of objects

Note that Unity **realy** doesn't like it if you reference scene objects in assets, and as such have made certain editor functions incompatible with them. Therefore if any object in the set is not persistent they're disabled, although you can still reorder, delete and click on them to see them in your scene view. Note that none of these conditions affect how they work under the hood, these precautions are merely related to the editor

## Script Reference
There are various ways to interact with the runtime set. Available are the following members

T this[int index]

IList Items { get; }
int Count { get; }
Type Type { get; }

void Add(T)
void Remove(T)
